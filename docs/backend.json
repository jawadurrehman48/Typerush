    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support user authentication (email/password, guest), profile storage, leaderboard functionality, and game statistics tracking in the TypeRush application. The structure prioritizes authorization independence and clear security rules. User profiles are stored in a private collection `/users/{userId}`, ensuring only the authenticated user can access their own profile. Leaderboard entries are stored in a global collection `/leaderboard`, allowing efficient querying and display of top scores. The `username` is denormalized into the `LeaderboardEntry` documents to avoid needing to perform a `get()` operation from the `users` collection in security rules to ensure that the user still has that username. This is critical for atomic updates. All reads on the `leaderboard` collection can be granted if the `username` matches the user and the `userId` is valid."
